== Description ==

CloudSearch is a flexible plugin that allows you to leverage the search index power of Amazon CloudSearch in your WordPress site.
To use this plugin you'll need an Amazon Web Services account. Attention: Amazon CloudSearch is a paid service and will require a credit card.

Before you can start using CloudSearch, the plugin needs to be activated and configured. Activate the plugin, then go to the menu "CloudSearch -> Settings" (you can find this menu in the sidebar of your WordPress admin panel).
Fill the form data:

* Enter Amazon access key ID, Amazon secret access key and Amazon region for your account (look for "Security Credentials" in your Amazon console to retrieve these data)
* Enter your CloudSearch index search endpoint and the domain name (I suggest to create the CloudSearch index before you start the plugin configuration)
* Schema settings
* Other settings

IMPORTANT NOTES WITH RELEASE 2.0.0:
* At least WordPress 4.4 version mandatory (for WP_Term support)
* Changed APIs output from an array of IDs to an array of object composed by the entity ID and the entity type

Minimum requirements:

* WordPress Version 4.4
* PHP Version 5.3
* Amazon Web Services account with CloudSearch enabled

= Usage =

1. Go to `CloudSearch -> Settings`
2. Enter your `Amazon access key ID`, `Secret access key` and the `Amazon region` where you have created the CloudSearch index
3. Enter a `Search endpoint` and the `Domain name`. Get these info in your CloudSearch dashboard in AWS Console
4. Choose post types, custom fields and custom taxonomies that you want to export to the CloudSearch index
5. Set up other settings or leave defaults
6. Save settings.
7. Go to `CloudSearch -> Manage`
8. Click the action `Create index`, `Run indexing` and `Sync all documents`. Between every action wait until the `Status` field is `Active`, then go on with the next task
9. After these operation your index is ready, now you can search documents in your CloudSearch index

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does the plugin cost? =

There is no charge for the plugin. The only charges you incur are for usage of Amazon CloudSearch.

By default, only posts and standard fields are indexed. To modify this, in the admin "Setting" section you can add other post types, fields and taxonomies (also custom objects).
